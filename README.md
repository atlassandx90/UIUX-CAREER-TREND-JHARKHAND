## Objective  
This project analyzes UI/UX career demand in Jharkhand using real search interest trends, city-wise interest distribution, demand vs supply analysis, and future forecasting.

We answer:

- Which Jharkhand cities show the highest UI/UX interest?
- How is the demand trending month-to-month?
- Is there a supply-demand gap in institutes vs learners?
- What will the UI/UX market look like by 2030?
